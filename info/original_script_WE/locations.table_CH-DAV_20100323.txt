# locations.table
#
# The locations.table files contain legacy information about measurement heights and sonic orientation.
#
# Note: each line which contains a hash sign (#) on the very beginning
# is considered to be a comment. Also blank lines are skipped.
#
# The columns to provide are:
#  1. beginning date (in non-american notation: dd.mm.yy)
#  2. beginning time (in 24 hours notation: hh:mm:ss)
#  3. ending date
#  4. ending time
#  5. time base: UTC, MEZ, MESZ, ADT or number of hours difference to
#     UTC (this is local time minus UTC)
#  6. measuring height above ground (meters) or, if you measured
#     measuring height above displacement height, then give this value
#     here and set the vegetation height and displacement height to NA
#  7. vegetation height above ground (meters) or NA
#  8. displacement height (meters) or NA
#  9. wind direction offset (angle between geogr. north and sonic north)
# 10. number of analog channels; this must be the same number as in the
#     header of the raw data file, if you do not want to end up
#     having problems later somewhere.
# 11. and more: depending on the settings in column 10. Starting
#     with column 11 the number of columns defined in 10 will
#     read as time lags in number of raw records (so this value
#     depends on the sampling rate!). Note: if you specify NU (not used)
#     in the lag column(s), this is equivalent to an exclude statement
#     in the calibration table when using the POLLUMET concept.
#     The next column is the prefix of the dataset (or NA).
#     The remaining columns are read in and concatenated to obtain
#     a string describing this location.
#
# If you choose the USEARCSSCONCEPT (see calibration.h), convertall will also
# check whether the LOCATIONs match between the calibration table specified
# by DEFAULTCALIBTAB in convertall.h, since it could be unclear from the 
# data filename, from which location the data are.
# In the USEPOLLUMETCONCEPT configuration it is assumed that all data file
# names start with prefix, followed by the time information. Such filenames
# would be too large for PCs running DOS, therefore there is no prefix
# for the USEARCSSCONCEPT (write NA in the appropriate column).
#
# Often times you will set the time lags to UK and run everything through
# converall determining the actual time lag. From this output you can
# make a statistics and determine an average time lag which you than can
# place in this table and reprocess the whole data after recompiling
# convertall with FINDACTUALLAG set to FALSE in convertall.h
# Normally the actual lag should be the best value to use, but for
# comparisions with people who only can process their data with a fixed
# time lag, this could be useful (or if the time lag seems to freak out
# when you run convertall with FINDACTUALLAG set TRUE).
